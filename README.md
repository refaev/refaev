PROFILE:

I do R&D in Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, SLAM and Computer Vision in Rafael ltd.

EXPERIENCE

2021 â€“ current: lecturer at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem Israel. [Course 67604 Vision Aided
Navigation](https://shnaton.huji.ac.il/index.php/NewSyl/67604/2/2022/). 

In this course we try to give the students a hands-on experience in implementing a Simultaneous
Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system for vehicle navigation using a stereo pair. [Syllabus.](https://shnaton.huji.ac.il/index.php/NewSyl/67604/2/2022/)

2021 - current: Computer vision Engeneer, Meta Inc.

I do cloud localization for AR/VR devices. 

2017 â€“ 2021: Researcher, Rafael ltd

- Deep Reinforcement Learning for obstacle avoidance. I took a DRL algorithms such as PPO and A2C,
added my algorithmic improvements and tuning, and trained an agent for vehicle autonomous
navigation and driving using only images as input in an end-to-end manner. I integrated it into an actual
driving robot.

- During this research, I spotted a new theoretical issue I call 'the manipulative consultant problem', and
by solving it I boosted the results dramatically. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10144) [code](https://github.com/ManipulativeConsultant/two-armed-bandit)

- Deep Reinforcement Learning for image matching â€“ I've implemented a search-guiding agent for image
retrieval task. It search the infrastructure like a human may do, and cut ~50% of searching time.

- I did obstacle avoidance in geometric methods such as Stereo-based depth reconstruction, deep learning
for freeway segmentation and RADAR tracking.

- Recently I worked on image segmentation of aerial images using VAE architecture, and thermal
sensor simulation using GAN architecture.

All of the work was done in Python, using Keras, Tensorflow or Pytorch.

2010 â€“ 2016 Senior Computer Vision Algorithms designer, Rafael ltd

My main area was Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and classic and deep machine learning for
various applications:

- Automatic mapping and 3d estimation of large scale areas, such as whole countries.
- Automatic electric-pole detection from aerial images using Classic Machine learning.
- Automatic vehicle and pedestrian detection from aerial images using machine and deep learning.
- 3D estimation and depth reconstruction from aerial images
- Accurate computer vision based navigation correction
- Active-Learning system for semi-automatic target classification, using a machine-learning boosting
method.
- Post mortem track reconstruction from video input.
- Stable out-of-image tracking. 
- Time to arrival estimation using computer vision.
Most of the work was done in C++ and Matlab

2005 â€“ 2010 Computer Vision engineer, Rafael ltd Implementing real-time SLAM systems:
- video tracking
- outlier removal
- bundle adjustment
- Soft Real-Time optimization
- Image processing algorithmic optimization
- GUI implementation for aerial mapping.
The work was done in C++ and C# with C interfaces
Note: Due to security classification issues, much of the work I done cannot be detailed, and most of the code
for the described project is classified.

EDUCATION

2012-2018: PhD in Computer Science at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel
My PhD was in Medical Image Processing in the Hebrew University, under the supervision of Prof. Leo Joskowicz.

My main subject was using Machine Learning Algorithms like Deep Neural Networks for the detection and
accurate segmentation and tracking of abdominal and pulmonary tumors, in longitudinal CT studies.
I also used deformable tissue registration, and video tracking of deformable tissues. Work was done in Matlab
and C++

2005-2008: MsC Cum Laude in Computer Science at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel
Avg: 92

Thesis: Facing the challenge of creating an Augmented Reality solution for laparoscopic nephrectomies
procedures (partial renal resection), I used novel computer vision algorithms for the 3D segmentation on kidney
anatomies in preoperative CT scans, as a pre-step for AR presentation to the surgeon.
2001-2004: B.Sc Cum Laude in Computer Science, bioinformatics and math at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem,
Israel Avg: 93.1

Final project: Protein secondary structure predictions using SVM and boosting methods.
